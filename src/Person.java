/**
 * SDA Scheduler application requirements

 * Create a class hierarchy
 * Person.java - firstname
 *             - lastname
 *             - dateOfBirth
 * Trainer.java (extends Person) - isAuthorized (boolean)
 * Student.java (extends Person) - hasPreviousJavaKnowledge (boolean)
 * Create a Group class which has
 * name (Java2Gdansk, Tester3Bucharest, etc)
 * one trainer
 * a list of students
 * Manually initialize 15 students; 4 groups and 3 trainers;
 * Store all students in a list; all groups in a list; all trainers in a list;
 * Asign a trainer to each group
 * Asign 2-3 students to each group
 * Ensure the fact that a group will only have distinct students (How would you do that?)
 * Ensure the fact that a group will only have a maximum of 5 students; When you try to add a 6th one throw an MaximumNumberOfStudentsReached exception
 * Display all students in a group sorted alphabetically by lastName
 * Display the group with the maximum number of students
 * Display all students younger than 25, from all groups
 * Display all students grouped by trainer that teaches to them (eg. Trainer1 - stud1, stud3, stud4; Trainer2 - stud2, stud 10) - regardless of the group they're part of (If you were to store this information in a data structure what would you use?)
 * Display all students with previous java knowledge
 * Display the group with the highest number of students with no previous java knowledge
 * Remove all the students younger than 20 from all groups
